# Vpc CloudFormation Template
*CloudFormation template to create a VPC*

## Resources Created
This template creates the following resources:

- VPC, plus:
    - Internet Gateway (and respective association to this VPC and default route)
    - Route Table for Internet Gateway (and respective association to the public subnets)

- Public Subnet in AZ A, plus:
    - Elastic IP A
    - NAT Gateway A (and respective association to subnet A)
    - Route Table for NAT Gateway A (and route)

- Public Subnet in AZ B, plus:
    - Elastic IP B
    - NAT Gateway B (and respective association to subnet B)
    - Route Table for NAT Gateway B
    - Route for NAT Gateway B

- Private Subnet A, plus:
    - Route table association to NAT Gateway A

- Private Subnet B, plus:
    - Route table association to NAT Gateway B

- VPC Flow Log:
    - Flow log itself (and respective IAM Role/Policy)
    - S3 Bucket (and respective policy)

**Notes:**  
1) Security groups are not in scope of this template, but your VPC will have one created anyway, by default - and quite permissive.  
2) The S3 bucket will be protected against deletion when you tear down the stack. Beware of that if you need to recreate the stack - if the bucket is still up, your deployment will fail.

## How to deploy

- With tested bash file:
To deploy, update the file `deploy-vpc.sh` with your stack info and run it. 


TODO: abstract bash file. It should allow me to deploy the stack running the following command:  


```bash
export STACK_NAME="Name for your stack"
export OWNER="name of team responsible for this stack"
export COMPLIANCE="Is your stack handling sensitive information?"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="your region"

export VPC_CIDR="your VPC CIDR"
export PUB_SUBNET_A_CIDR="your public subnet in AZ A CIDR"
export PUB_SUBNET_A_CIDR="your public subnet in AZ B CIDR"
export PUB_SUBNET_A_CIDR="your private subnet in AZ A CIDR"
export PUB_SUBNET_A_CIDR="your private subnet in AZ B CIDR"
./deploy-vpc-abstracted.sh
```
